  breadText: 'Some areas are radioactive, visualized by a green cloud. 

	

	you can stay in a radioactive zone for a while but your suit will get slowly radiated and beyond a critical level where you will puke and increase hunger. 

	

	your suit wil go down below critical but if you want to enter a radiated area again you need to remove the radiation from the suit.
