  breadText: 'To escape the cosmic graveyard you need to build a spaceship in the hangar. 

	

	The spaceship then needs to be powered by 3 fusion cores that can be retreved from a titan. 

	

	The titan can be summoned by puting a beacon disk in the Beacon. 

	

	Make sure to build defences before doing this. '
